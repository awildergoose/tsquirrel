# tsquirrel

This project transpiles TypeScript projects into [VScript](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VScript) / [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/), mainly made for Valve's [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/).

## Installation / Usage

You can run the transpiler by running the `watch` script from the package.json<br />

To test in a standard (non-Valve) Squirrel environment:<br />

1. You'll need to compile Squirrel yourself from [here](https://github.com/albertodemichelis/squirrel/releases/tag/v3.2). (CMake worked for me, use whatever works best for you though)
2. Run the `watchtest` script from the package.json<br />
